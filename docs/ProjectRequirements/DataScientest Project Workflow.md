## Stepwise Project Timeline

### Step 0: Framing (Kickoff Meeting)

- **Deadline:** *Date to be inserted*
- **Objective:** Initial meeting to validate project framing and expectations.


### Step 1: Data Mining \& Visualization

- **Deadline:** Thursday, October 2nd
- **Tasks:**
    - Define the context and scope of the project.
    - Gain thorough understanding of the domain concepts.
    - Perform exhaustive data analysis to uncover structure, challenges, and biases.
- **Template for Data Audit:** [TEMPLATE - Data Audit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JI7_DBcSXJl5UxB8VY-Ybyr3T1NdK0PCDkO1t-ZRjj8/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Required Outputs:**
    - At least 5 relevant graphical representations from your dataset.
    - For each graphic: Include detailed commentary with business insights and validate via statistical manipulation or tests.


### Step 2: Pre-Processing \& Feature Engineering

- **Deadline:** Thursday, October 16th
- **Tasks:**
    - Clean and preprocess the dataset based on previous insights.
    - Transform, add, or enrich features as required.
    - Ensure readiness for advanced analysis or modeling.
- **Rendering 1:** Submit data exploration, visualization, and pre-processing report.
- **Note:** After submitting Rendering 1 (if not already done), the instructor will create a group GitHub repository using a provided template. This repo must be sent to the jury along with the final report.


### Step 3: Modeling

- **Overall Deadline:** Thursday, November 13th


#### Modeling Step 1

- **Deadline:** Thursday, October 23rd
- **Tasks:**
    - First modeling iterations with baseline models.
    - Analyze initial results, assess relevance and model performance.


#### Modeling Step 2

- **Deadline:** Thursday, November 6th
- **Tasks:**
    - Apply Machine Learning and statistical metrics for model evaluation.
    - Optimize models, experiment with advanced and alternate approaches, compare outcomes.


#### Modeling Step 3

- **Tasks:**
    - Advanced modeling: Bagging/boosting and Deep Learning.
    - Utilize interpretability tools for deeper insight.
    - Draw scientific and business conclusions from modeling outcomes.
- **Rendering 2:** Submit the modeling report.


### Step 4: Final Report \& GitHub Submission

- **Deadline:** Friday, November 21st
- **Tasks:**
    - Compile the final report (combining previous submissions, conclusion, and reflection).
    - Submit clean, commented code on GitHub.
    - Time permitting, refine models and documentation during this step.


### Step 5: Streamlit Application \& Defense

- **Deadline:** December 1st (to be confirmed)
- **Defense Methodology Summary:** [Defense_Methodology](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bF9K4yBjaeWvBRdnNCIpwHDLqdZUHX1VRiEpQOQPY0A/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Presentation Structure:**
    - 20 minutes presentation.
    - 10 minutes jury Q\&A.
- **Presentation Options:**
    - PowerPoint plus Streamlit demo.
    - Entirely via Streamlit application.
- **Application Requirements:**
    - Appealing design with multiple tabs.
    - Well-organized code; avoid re-training the model live.
    - Bug-free operation.

## Important Guidelines

- **Report Quality:** Intermediate and final submissions must meet high standards regarding illustrations, layout, and spelling.
- **Timeliness:** Late or substandard reports result in project invalidation.
- **Support:** Arrange a Zoom call this week to validate the framing stage ([Today @ 4pm](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82287783978?pwd=0yulgntDbVISbkLUrIvbIab4CCIb44.1)). Reach out to [Teaching Assistants](https://calendly.com/d/cmd6-vh4-6cd/teaching-assistant-cursus-ds?month=2025-05) for individual assistance if needed at any point.
- **Action:** Confirm your reading and availability to help finalize the kickoff meeting time slot.
